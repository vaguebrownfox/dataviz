# Next.js Template - present

## How to use

Download the example [or clone the repo](https://github.com/vaguebrownfox/present):

Install it and run:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

## The idea behind the template

The project uses [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js), which is a framework for server-rendered React apps.
It includes `@mui/material` and its peer dependencies, including `emotion`, the default style engine in MUI v5.
If you prefer, you can [use styled-components instead](https://mui.com/guides/interoperability/#styled-components).
